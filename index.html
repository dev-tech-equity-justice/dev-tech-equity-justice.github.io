The fellows will be trained from little or no coding knowledge to fully capable software engineers earning competitive salaries. Fellows will be paid a stipend of Rs. 16,000.00 a month throughout the program.</p><p class="region-tn body2">The TEJ Fellows are selected following a rigorous selection process. The nine month fellowship is conducted in two phases: I) The Coding Bootcamp phase is an in-person six-month full-time training where we teach JavaScript language for frontend and backend. The training is facilitated by highly experienced IT Engineers with work experience in the United States and Nepal. II) The Internship phase is focused on putting technical training to practical use. It includes soft skills training in communications and job search skills to find and grow in good jobs in Nepali and international companies.</p></div><div><p class="h5">PRE BOOTCAMP</p><p class="region-tn body2">At TEJ, recognizing the gender disparity in the technology sector and learning from our own experience in difficulties faced by women in learning technology, we have designed a three-month part-time Introduction to JavaScript Pre Bootcamp specifically for women from marginalized and underrepresented communities. This is a free program with five hours per week in-class, and an additional commitment of 10-15hrs per week to do the workshops and exercises. The fellows will be trained from little or no coding experience to a having solid foundation in programming fundamentals with a focus on JavaScript.</p><p class="region-tn body2">The pre-bootcamp fellows are selected through an application process. The program has a weekly rhythm, where we introduce a new programming concept each week that builds on previous weeks&#x27; lessons. The knowledge is further explored by doing the assigned exercises, with additional help provided via an online community and office hours.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="light-block"><div class="wrapper"><p class="h2" id="about">ABOUT US</p><div class="region-md grid grid-2up"><div><p class="h5">WHAT IS TEJ?</p><p class="body2">Globally, the tech industry is acknowledging the lack of diversity within the sector and companies are creating resource groups to increase their diversity. TEJ is focusing on the supply side to train highly competent software engineers from underrepresented communities by:</p><div class="bullet"><ul><li>Prioritizing equity in caste, class and gender</li><li>Providing high quality fullstack javascript coding training</li><li>Augmenting technical skills with soft skills</li><li>Removing barriers to entry by providing stipends, afternoon classes, and other supportive resources</li><li>Mentoring by experienced industry professionals</li><li>Ongoing engagement after graduation</li></ul></div> </div><div><p class="h5">WHY TEJ?</p><p class="region-tn body2">The technology industry has constantly faced a shortage of good software engineers. As the supply of computer engineering graduates has not been able to meet the demand, the last 10 years has seen the emergence of coding bootcamps in North America and Europe that are conducted in terms of six months or less. The bootcamp has proven to be a successful model, and employers now recruit from them just as they do from universities. These coding bootcamps provide unmatched return on investment as they prepare students for jobs in a short period.</p><p class="region-tn body2">In Nepal, the representation of historically marginalized communities in the technology sector has been dramatically lower than those from privileged class and caste groups due to structural barriers, including a lack of access to information and resources. To address this issue and close the gap, TEJ has created a nine month coding fellowship designed to ensure the success of students from underrepresented groups and communities.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="dark-block"><div class="wrapper flow-xlg"><div class="grid grid-2up"><div><p class="h2 h2-margin-top--20">ELIGIBILITY</p></div><div class="flow-lg"><p class="body2">At TEJ Fellowship, we recruit and invest in candidates from marginalized and underrepresented communities in technology.
